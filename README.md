# Remaining-Useful-Life-Prediction-Based-on-a-Multi-Sensor-Data-Fusion_Model
This project implements a robust framework for accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of complex machinery using multi-sensor time-series data. By leveraging data fusion techniques, the model combines information from multiple sensors to capture the underlying degradation patterns and operational conditions, enabling precise predictions of equipment failure timelines.
Key features of the project include:
Multi-sensor data processing: Handles diverse time-series signals from different sensors.
Advanced fusion techniques: Integrates information across sensors to enhance prediction accuracy.
RUL estimation: Provides predictive insights to support proactive maintenance and minimize downtime.
Scalable implementation: Suitable for real-world industrial datasets and operational environments.
This repository includes all data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model implementation, and evaluation scripts to reproduce the results.
